        "There are several types of computer-vision tasks, and determining the location of and object within an image is a different type of problem called *object detection*. Let's look at the variety of frequent computer-vision tasks and the questions they purport to answer.\n",

        "\n",
        "> The task of classification assigns an image with the class(es) of the object(s) present in the image. It answers the question: \"Is there an object of class X in the image?\" Classification is one of the most fundamental computer-vision tasks. In an image, there might be object of more than one class called multiclass classification. The label in this case for one image would be a list of all object classes that the image contains."
