        "# Introduction\n",
        "There are several types of computer-vision tasks, and determining the location of and object within an image is a different type of problem called *object detection*. Let's look at the variety of frequent computer-vision tasks and the questions they purport to answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Classification** \n",
        "\n",
        "> The task of classification assigns an image with the class(es) of the object(s) present in the image. It answers the question: \"Is there an object of class X in the image?\" Classification is one of the most fundamental computer-vision tasks. In an image, there might be object of more than one class called multiclass classification. The label in this case for one image would be a list of all object classes that the image contains.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Localization**\n",
        "> The downside of classification is that it does not tell us where in the image a particular object is, how big or small it is, or how many objects there are. It only tell us that an object of a particular class exists somewhere within it. *Localization*, otherwise known as *classification with localization*, can inform us which classes are in an image and where they are located within the image. \n",
        "\n",
        "> Localization will work correctly only when it is guaranteed that there is a single instance of each class. If there is more than one instance of a class, one bounding box might encompass some or all the objects of that class (depending upon the probabilities)."
